I'm new to C (and programming in general) and I wanted to try solving this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). This is a repository containing the code from my solutions.

Both solutions for dayXX can be compiled using `make` and then run using `./solutionX <filename>`. If no filename is used, the `input.txt` will be taken as the default. 

Some of the helper functions were not written by me. Appropriate credits are given where applicable.
